      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <p>I picked this web page because I think it is “simple yet poorly-designed”: 
          It is a simple website for a family-owned pizzeria, which basically shows its location, 
          menu, introduction, and pictures. </p>
      </div>

      <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem;" >Finding Problems</h3>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Mental vs Conceptual model</h4>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">      
        <h5>Mental model: </h5>
        <p>When entering the website of a pizzeria, people would mostly think of :</p>
        <ol>
          <li>See the menu</li>
          <li>How to order (phone or online?)</li>
          <li>Check the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <h5>Conceptual model:</h5>
        <p>This website provides the conceptual model in these parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Showing the menu</li>
          <li>Providing the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
          <li>Showing the pictures</li>
          <li>Introducing the history(about us)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 15%;">Usability</h4>
        <ol>
          <b><li>Menu- hard to spot on large devices. </li></b>
          <p>One of the most important contents of the website is the menu. 
            On the mobile side, the menu stands out at the center, 
            with the high-contrast comparison for the background and the black border.  
          </p>
          <p>However, the menu button is not very visible on larger devices, 
            for example, it is in the middle of the left column, where the eye-catching 
            middle is a large picture of the interior. 
          </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis1.jpg" alt="prob1" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis2.jpg" alt="prob2" style="width:60%">
          </div>
          <b><li>Hard to spot important information </li></b>
          <p>
            Similiarly, when the user visits the website, another important thing is the 
            contact information for the pizzeria. In this case, it would be the location, 
            phone number,  hours, and delivery availability. 
            As discussed above, the website's large device display did not provide a proper 
            text hierarchy for the information. They are located in the top right corner, with 
            a relatively small font. Such an arrangement will make it difficult for the users 
            to effectively find the information.
          </p>
          <b><li>Low font color contrast</li></b>
          <p>Some of the texts are in low contrast with the background, 
            which makes them hard to read. For example, the navigation 
            “Home, Gallery, About Us” bar, when selected, turns to a grey color, 
            which is really hard to read on the orange background. The same with the
            “show more” at the bottom of the gallery. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis3.jpg" alt="prob3" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Misaligned paragraph</li></b>
          <p>The whole paragraph in the “About Us” section is awkwardly arranged. 
            The paragraph is too compact, and there are unnecessary line breaks, 
            which makes the reading experience a bit difficult.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis4.jpg" alt="prob4" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Gallery pictures do not have proper labels</li></b>
          <p>The pictures in the “Gallery” are named with numbers and 
            do not have any comments on them, and the customers will have no idea what the dish 
            is called. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis5.jpg" alt="prob5" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Empty white region</li></b>
          <p>The website is scrollable on both mobile and desktop devices. 
            However, on the desktop device with a larger display, there is a 
            blank space with the copyright information, which is not part of the footer. 
            There might be something wrong with the structure of the code, and 
            I will try to figure it out in a later part.</p>
          <img src="assets/sakis6.jpg" alt="prob6" style="width:60%">
         
          <b><li> Misplaced facebook link</li></b>
          <p>The website provides the function of Facebook likes. 
            Its placement looks fine on the larger device display, 
            but the button is misplaced in the mobile version, which is 
            misaligned with the “find us on Facebook”. </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis8.jpg" alt="prob8" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis7.jpg" alt="prob7" style="width:60%">
          </div>          
        </ol>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Learnability</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the previous evaluation of usability, 
          the first-time visitor who wants to see the information 
          and the menu would have to browse between the left and 
          right of the website. Since this website does not provide 
          an online order service, its function is fairly simple and 
          straightforward. The users would not spend too much time on 
          getting their target, but it would still take more time than expected.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Memorability</h4>
        <p>Similarly, since the website's function is fairly simple, 
          the user would not have too much trouble finding their target when 
          revisiting the website after a while. 
        </p>

        <p>There are no headings for the website, making it poorly structured.</p>

        <img src="assets/w2.jpg" alt="w2" style="width:50%">
        <p>The color contrast between the text and the background is too low,

        <p>Some of the text is too small, also making it very hard to read.</p>

        <img src="assets/w5.jpg" alt="w5" style="width:50%">
        <p>The menu is linked to an external PDF file. I am not sure how to fix this though...</p>

        <img src="assets/w6.jpg" alt="w6" style="width:50%">
        <p>The alt description is not properly used. It might be better
          to add more descriptive text.

          <li>
            <b>Menu problem: </b><br>For the container of the "menu" background, I use position: relative; 
            so that I can keep a relative position with the button.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Overall responsiveness: </b><br>I also use display: block for each div because there are not many 
            flex elements required (besides the gallery and the later info images, 
            for which I use the row and column to adjust them better accordingly). <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Overall responsiveness 2: </b><br>I'm using rem font size for h1, h2, and h3 so that they're relative to the 
            root element and responsive on different device sizes while 
            maintaining proper text hierarchy.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Overall responsiveness 3: </b><br>For side-by-side elements, such as the image and text in location & hours, 
            I used the float:left and right. I also adjusted the margin for a 
            better appearance.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Gallery display: </b><br>I adjusted the image sizes so that they will align better in the gallery. 
            For the gallery layout, I referred to 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_css_team.asp">w3schools</a>
            for the alignment and 
            display. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Other problems: Alt text; text font, contrast and size; paragraph alignment</b> <br>I have adjusted
            them accordingly. See the redesigned website for more details.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            There are interactive elements on the page, though not many. <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Menu problem: </b><br>
                When hovering above the menu button, its color changes and 
                implies that it is clickable; when clicked, it links to the menu 
                pdf file. I know it is not a good option, but since time is limited 
                and I do not know much about interactive page construction, I will 
                leave it as it was. Sorry. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Find improtant information: </b><br>
                When scrolling down, the “top” button appears on the right side. 
                I used a little Javascript here 
                (credit to 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp">w3schools.</a>) <br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Misplaced Facebook link: </b><br>
                I have also linked the Facebook like button at the bottom, 
                which is clickable. The code is from 
                <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button"> Facebook.</a><br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                I initially wanted to use a navigation bar at the top/side, but since the original 
                website is relatively simple with only a few elements(menu, info, gallery and about us), I decided to discard the navigation bar.<br><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please see the code comments for more information and citations.<br>Many thanks to w3schools! I would not have finished it without its amazing tutorials :')</p>

      <p><b>Please notice</b> that the actual phone layout is different from the low-fi and hi-fi prototype. <br><br>
      I originally wantted to have the gallery with <b>one</b> image each row, 
      but it seems that the gallery would be a little too long and the 
      user would have to scroll for quite a long time. And the display works well for <b>two</b>
      images at the same time, so I decided to keep the actural layout design with
      two images instead of one.<p>
