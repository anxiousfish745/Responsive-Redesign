      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <p>I picked this web page because I think it is “simple yet poorly-designed”: 
          It is a simple website for a family-owned pizzeria, which basically shows its location, 
          menu, introduction, and pictures. </p>
      </div>

    <div class="row" style="background-color: rgba(220, 211, 204, 0.3)">
      <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem;" >Finding Problems</h3>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Mental vs Conceptual model</h4>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">      
        <h5>Mental model: </h5>
        <p>When entering the website of a pizzeria, people would mostly think of :</p>
        <ol>
          <li>See the menu</li>
          <li>How to order (phone or online?)</li>
          <li>Check the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <h5>Conceptual model:</h5>
        <p>This website provides the conceptual model in these parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Showing the menu</li>
          <li>Providing the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
          <li>Showing the pictures</li>
          <li>Introducing the history(about us)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <h4 style="text-align: center; padding-top: 15%;">Usability</h4>
        <ol>
          <b><li>Menu- hard to spot on large devices. </li></b>
          <p>One of the most important contents of the website is the menu. 
            On the mobile side, the menu is standing out at the center, 
            with the high-contrast comparison for the background and the black border.  
          </p>
          <p>However, the menu button is not very visible on larger devices, 
            for example, it is in the middle of the left column, where the eye-catching 
            middle is a large picture of the interior. 
          </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis1.jpg" alt="prob1" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis2.jpg" alt="prob2" style="width:60%">
          </div>
          <b><li>Hard to spot important information </li></b>
          <p>
            Similiarly, when the user visits the website, another important thing is the 
            contact information for the pizzeria. In this case, it would be the location, 
            phone number,  hours, and delivery availability. 
            As discussed above, the website's large device display did not provide a proper 
            text hierarchy for the information. They are located in the top right corner, with 
            a relatively small font. Such an arrangement will make it difficult for the users 
            to find the information effectively.
          </p>
          <b><li>Low font color contrast</li></b>
          <p>Some of the texts are in low contrast with the background, 
            which makes them hard to read. For example, the navigation 
            “Home, Gallery, About Us” bar, when selected, turns to a grey color, 
            which is really hard to read on the orange background. The same with the
            “show more” at the bottom of the gallery. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis3.jpg" alt="prob3" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Misaligned paragraph</li></b>
          <p>The whole paragraph in the “About Us” section is awkwardly arranged. 
            The paragraph is too compact, and there are unnecessary line breaks, 
            which makes the reading experience a bit difficult.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis4.jpg" alt="prob4" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Gallery pictures do not have proper labels</li></b>
          <p>The pictures in the “Gallery” are named with numbers and 
            do not have any comments on them, and the customers will have no idea what the dish 
            is called. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis5.jpg" alt="prob5" style="width:60%">
          <b><li>Empty white region</li></b>
          <p>The website is scrollable, on both mobile and desktop devices. 
            However, on the desktop device with a larger display, there is a 
            blank space with the copyright information, which is not part of the footer. 
            There might be something wrong with the structure of the code, and 
            I will try to figure it out in a later part.</p>
          <img src="assets/sakis6.jpg" alt="prob6" style="width:60%">
         
          <b><li> Misplaced facebook link</li></b>
          <p>The website provides the function of facebook likes. 
            Its placement looks fine on the larger device display, 
            but the button is misplaced in the mobile version, which is 
            misaligned with the “find us on facebook”. </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis8.jpg" alt="prob8" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis7.jpg" alt="prob7" style="width:60%">
          </div>          
        </ol>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Learnability</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the previous evaluation of usability, 
          the first-time visitor who wants to see the information and 
          the menu would have to browse between the left and right of the website. 
          Since this website does not provide online order service, its function 
          is fairly simple and straightforward. The users would not spend too much 
          time on getting their target, but it still would take more time than expected.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Memorability</h4>
        <p>Similarly, since the website's function is fairly simple, 
          the user would not have too much trouble getting their target when 
          revisiting the website after a while. 
        </p>

      <h4>Results from WebAIM WAV:</h4>
      <ol>

        <img src="assets/w1.jpg" alt="w1" style="width:50%">
        <p>There is no headings for the website, made it poorly structured.</p>

        <img src="assets/w2.jpg" alt="w2" style="width:50%">
        <p>The color contrast between the text and the background is too low,

        </div>    
        <p>Some text are too small, also making it very hard to read.</p>

        <img src="assets/w5.jpg" alt="w5" style="width:50%">
        <p>The menu is linked to an external PDF file. I am not sure how to fix this though...</p>

        <img src="assets/w6.jpg" alt="w6" style="width:50%">
        <p>The alt description is not properly used. It might be better
          to add more descriptive texts.

        <ol>
          <li>
            For the container of the “menu” background, I use the position: 
            relative; so that i would keep a relative position with the button. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            I also use display: block for each div because there are not many 
            flex elements required (besides the gallery and the later info images, 
            which I use the row and column to adjust them better accordingly). <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>For h1,h2 and h3, I am using rem font size so that they would be 
            relative to the root element, which would be responsive in different 
            device sizes while keeping the proper text hierarchy.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            For side-by-side elements, such as the image and text in location & hours, 
            I used the float:left and right. I also adjusted the margin for a 
            better appearance.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            I adjusted the image sizes so that they will align better in the gallery. 
            For the gallery layout, I referred to 
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_css_team.asp">w3schools</a>
            for the alignment and 
            display. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            There are interactive elements on the page, though not many. <br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When hovering above the menu button, its color changes and 
                implies that it is clickable; when clicked, it links to the menu 
                pdf file. I know it is not a good option, but since time is limited 
                and I do not know much about interactive page construction, I will 
                leave it as it was. Sorry. <br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                When scrolling down, the “top” button appears on the right side. 
                I used a little Javascript here 
                (credit to 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/HOWTO/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp">w3schools.</a>) <br><br>
              </li>
              <li>
                I have also linked the Facebook like button at the bottom, 
                which is clickable. I get the code from 
                <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button">Facebook.</a><br><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many thanks to w3schools! I would not finish it without its amazing tutorials :')</p>
