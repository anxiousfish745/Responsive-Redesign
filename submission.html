      <h2>Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Picking a Web page</h3>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">
        <img src = "assets/sakis.jpg" alt = "original screenshot" style="width:90%">
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <p>I picked this web page because I think it is “simple yet poorly-designed”: 
          It is a simple website for a family-owned pizzeria, which basically shows its location, 
          menu, introduction, and pictures. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row" style="background-color: rgb(175, 137, 105,30%)">
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Finding Problems</h3>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Mental vs Conceptual model</h4>
      <div style="float:left; width:40%; margin-left: 10%;">      
        <h5>Mental model: </h5>
        <p>When entering the website of a pizzeria, people would mostly think of :</p>
        <ol>
          <li>See the menu</li>
          <li>How to order (phone or online?)</li>
          <li>Check the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div style="float:right; width:45%">
        <h5>Conceptual model:</h5>
        <p>This website provides the conceptual model in these parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Showing the menu</li>
          <li>Providing the pizzeria's info (location, phone, hours)</li>
          <li>Showing the pictures</li>
          <li>Introducing the history(about us)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h4 style="text-align: center;">Usability</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Menu- hard to spot on large devices. </b></li>
          <p>One of the most important contents of the website is the menu. 
            On the mobile side, the menu is standing out at the center, 
            with the high-contrast comparison for the background and the black border.  
          </p>
          <p>However, the menu button is not very visible on larger devices, 
            for example, it is in the middle of the left column, where the eye-catching 
            middle is a large picture of the interior. 
          </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis1.jpg" alt="prob1" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis2.jpg" alt="prob2" style="width:60%">
          </div>
          <li><b>Hard to spot important information </b></li>
          <p>
            Similiarly, when the user visits the website, another important thing is the 
            contact information for the pizzeria. In this case, it would be the location, 
            phone number,  hours, and delivery availability. 
            As discussed above, the website's large device display did not provide a proper 
            text hierarchy for the information. They are located in the top right corner, with 
            a relatively small font. Such an arrangement will make it difficult for the users 
            to find the information effectively.
          </p>
          <li><b>Low font color contrast</b></li>
          <p>Some of the texts are in low contrast with the background, 
            which makes them hard to read. For example, the navigation 
            “Home, Gallery, About Us” bar, when selected, turns to a grey color, 
            which is really hard to read on the orange background. The same with the
            “show more” at the bottom of the gallery. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis3.jpg" alt="prob3" style="width:60%">
          <li><b>Misaligned paragraph</b></li>
          <p>The whole paragraph in the “About Us” section is awkwardly arranged. 
            The paragraph is too compact, and there are unnecessary line breaks, 
            which makes the reading experience a bit difficult.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis4.jpg" alt="prob4" style="width:60%">
          <li><b>Gallery pictures do not have proper labels</b></li>
          <p>The pictures in the “Gallery” are named with numbers and 
            do not have any comments on them, and the customers will have no idea what the dish 
            is called. </p>
          <img src="assets/sakis5.jpg" alt="prob5" style="width:60%">
          <li><b>Empty white region</b></li>
          <p>The website is scrollable, on both mobile and desktop devices. 
            However, on the desktop device with a larger display, there is a 
            blank space with the copyright information, which is not part of the footer. 
            There might be something wrong with the structure of the code, and 
            I will try to figure it out in a later part.</p>
          <img src="assets/sakis6.jpg" alt="prob6" style="width:60%">
         
          <li><b> Misplaced facebook link</b></li>
          <p>The website provides the function of facebook likes. 
            Its placement looks fine on the larger device display, 
            but the button is misplaced in the mobile version, which is 
            misaligned with the “find us on facebook”. </p>
          <div id = "interface">
            <img src="assets/sakis8.jpg" alt="prob8" style="width:25%; margin-right: 10%;">
            <img src="assets/sakis7.jpg" alt="prob7" style="width:60%">
          </div>          
        </ol>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Learnability</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the previous evaluation of usability, 
          the first-time visitor who wants to see the information and 
          the menu would have to browse between the left and right of the website. 
          Since this website does not provide online order service, its function 
          is fairly simple and straightforward. The users would not spend too much 
          time on getting their target, but it still would take more time than expected.
        </p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Memorability</h4>
        <p>Similarly, since the website's function is fairly simple, 
          the user would not have too much trouble getting their target when 
          revisiting the website after a while. 
        </p>

      <ol>
        <li>No headings. </li>
        <img src="assets/w1.jpg" alt="w1" style="width:60%">
        <p>There is no headings for the website, made it poorly structured.</p>
        <li>Text color contrast too low.</li>
        <img src="assets/w2.jpg" alt="w2" style="width:60%">
        <p>The color contrast between the text and the background is too low,

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <div class="box" style="background-color: rgb(255,150,18,10%); ">
        <p>Sakis Pizzeria was established on August 5, 1982 and was founded by owner Dionisios (Dennis) Sampalis. <br>
          <br>
          The goal was to create a pizzeria serving delicious, affordable food with a Greek twist to the downtown Providence 
          public. The small family business was opened in one of Providence's oldest historic buildings, across the street 
          from the Providence Preforming Arts Center and Johnson & Wales University. In 2010, after years of planning, the 
          Sampalis family undertook the renovations of the historic building and the restaurant, transforming Sakis Pizzeria 
          to include a full service pizzeria, bar and grille.<br>
          <br>
          Today, as you enter the pizzeria, a winding staircase leads you to the new mezzanine overlooking Weybosset Street, 
          where our clientele can enjoy a few drinks while sampling our new menu and watching a sports game. Our redesigned 
          menu features new items and old favorites including specialty pizzas, salads, wraps, paninis, grinders, pasta dishes, 
          club sandwiches, various seafood platters, Greek sandwiches and Greek pastries.<br>
          <br>
          We take pride in every dish that leaves our kitchen and hope that Sakis Pizzeria is and will continue to be your 
          neighborhood choice for dining in or taking out.<br>
          <br>
          We greatly appreciate our loyal customers that we have been serving since 1982 and look forward to impressing 
          our new customers!<br>
          <br>
          We thank you for your business and continued support!<br>
          <br>
